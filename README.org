* My personal digital garden and blog.

I'm using [[https://github.com/rasendubi/uniorg][uniorg]] and [[https://nextjs.org/][Next.js]] to publish [[ https://www.orgroam.com/ ][org-roam]] notes.

* How to use:
** Develop locally:
1) Put your notes to ./public/roam
2) Start server with: npx next dev
Server should be up and running on [[http:localhost:3000]]
** Deploy the example using [[https:vercel.com][vercel]].
** Extra functionalities:
